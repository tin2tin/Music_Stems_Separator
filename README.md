# Music Stems Separator
A music stems separator for the Blender Video Sequence Editor using Spleeter.

## Installation and first run
Run Blender as administrator before installing the add-on and the first run, since all the python modules need to be installed. This can be a bit time-consuming, so grab a coffee. 

Ffmpeg needs to be installed in PATH for it to work. On Windows this python script can be run to do it automatically: https://github.com/Crozzers/ffmpeg-installer

If ffmpeg can't be found after adding it to PATH, use this add-on to uninstall ffmpeg(type it in): https://github.com/amb/blender_pip
